# Project Plan

## Summary

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 5 sentences. -->
In this project, data on air quality at airports as well as the surrounding areas are analyzed. 
The question "Is there a connection between airports and particulate matter?" is to be answered. 

## Rationale

<!-- Outline the impact of the analysis, e.g. which pains it solves. -->
The analysis helps the government make better decisions with regard to approving construction plans for new airports. It also helps to make better recommendations for the health of residents living near airports.
